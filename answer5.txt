To find all UUIDs in JSON files within a directory and its subdirectories. Here is a high-level description of a possible solution:

1. Traversing the Directory Structure:

Utilize a library like os (in Python) to navigate through the directory structure.
Employ os.walk to iterate through the root directory, its subdirectories, and all files within them.

2. Identifying JSON Files:

Within the loop of os.walk, check if the current file ends with the .json extension.
You can use string methods like endswith to perform this check.

3. Reading File Content:

If the file is a JSON file, use open to open it in read mode ('r').
Read the entire content of the file using read and store it in a string variable.

4. Finding UUIDs with Regular Expressions:

Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching.
Define a regular expression pattern that matches the format of UUIDs (e.g., \b[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}\b). This pattern matches a UUID format consisting of alphanumeric characters separated by hyphens.
Use the re library (in Python) to search for matches of this pattern within the JSON file content.

5. Validating and Storing UUIDs:

Not every match found by the regular expression might be a valid UUID.
Use a UUID library (e.g., uuid library in Python) to validate each potential match.
If the validation confirms a valid UUID, add it to a list or data structure to store all found UUIDs.

By following these steps, you can effectively extract UUIDs from JSON files within a directory and its subdirectories.
